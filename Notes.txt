Steps followed in AWS to deploy this App:
1. Define the VPC and Subnets (2 subnets are needed in order to use AWS RDS):

    A VPC: learning-aws-vpc: with 2 CIDRs:
            10.0.0.0/24
            11.0.0.0/24

    2 Subnets:
        learning-aws-subnet:
            CIDR: 10.0.0.0/24
            availability Zone: use1-az4
        learning-aws-subnet-2:
            CIDR: 11.0.0.0/24
            availability Zone: use1-az5

   An Internet Gateway: learning-aws-gateway
   The Route Table of the 2 Subnets needs an entry pointing to the *Gateway*:
     Destination: 0.0.0.0/0
     Target: [gateway]

   A Security Group: with rules to allow traffic form ANYWHERE for TCP for the ports 80, 8080 and 3306 (mySql)

2. Crate a MySQL DB, using the VPC above

2. Create an APP in AWS ElasticBeanstalk, and 2 environments, for DEv and for PROD:

    On each Environment, we need to set this Environment Property, to avoid a 502 nginx error:
    PORT: 8080
    SPRING_PROFILES_ACTIVE: "dev" or "prod"

    In the PROD environment, we also need the following properties, which are referenced in the SpringBoot App:
    RDS_DB_NAME:
    RDS_HOSTNAME:
    RDS_PASSWORD:
    RDS_PORT:
    RDS_USERNAME:
    We take the values form the RDS config.
